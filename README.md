# Star Warfare for PS VITA
This port is based on the **1.0.2** decompilation project of **Star Warfare: Alien Invasion** (or 2.97 in-game version) by [Decomp And Recomp](https://github.com/Decomp-And-Recomp/Star-Warfare) with adjustements to controls and minor optimizations for the platform.

# Setting up
For the best experience, I recommend enabling overclocking to reduce stutters as much as possible.

# Patching
- Download Star Warfare VPK from VitaDB/Github and install it.
- Go to the [decompilation project](https://github.com/Decomp-And-Recomp/Star-Warfare/releases/tag/1.0.2) release page and download ```Star.Warfare.Android.apk```.
- Extract it.
- Put the ```.apk``` inside the extracted folder and name it ```SW(.apk)```.
- Launch ```ApplyPatch.bat``` and wait (Can take several minutes depending on your system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ```SW_FILES.zip```.
- Open VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy the contents of the .ZIP file (Not the ZIP file itself, just files inside it) over to ```ux0:app/STAR10000/``` (Picture Below of how it should look after copying everything).
